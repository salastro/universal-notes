Btrfs (B-Tree File System) is a modern file system developed by Oracle, designed
to address the shortcomings of traditional file systems like [[ext4]]. Its main
features include support for [[snapshots]] and [[subvolumes]], built-in [[RAID]],
data deduplication, and [[dynamic inode allocation]]. Btrfs is designed for
high-capacity storage and offers improved scalability, reliability, and
performance.
