This shell script enables the user to quickly select and insert emojis via a graphical interface. The selection is done using [[dmenu]]. After the selection is done, it is copied to the clipboard, using [[xclip]], and then typed using [[xdotool]]. Then, it moves the selected emoji to the top of the file for faster access in future selections.
