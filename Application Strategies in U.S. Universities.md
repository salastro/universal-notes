**Key Question:**

- **What skills can you bring to the research team?**
- **How much are you compatible with the research team (vision, culture, skillset, etc)?**
- **How fast can you learn the team’s workflow, tools, etc?**
- Answering this is crucial for interviews and catching the supervisor's attention to your CV.

**Application Strategy ([[Bottom-Up Approach]]):**

- Focus on your skills rather than just research topics.
- Identify how your skills align with the team’s needs.
- Use this information to highlight your contributions in your [[personal statement]].
